In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decison-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust that participates must place in one another and deter their ability to exert authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.
